**Radiation Exposure Analysis - A Case Study focussing on loops**

Case Study Story:
Dr Ellen, a renowned physicist, is conducting an
experiment to measure the average radiation levels in various environments with
high amounts of radioactive waste. Over several weeks, she collects a vast
amount of data from different locations, ranging from urban areas to dense
forests. She also takes measurements at varying distances from the known
sources of the radiation, so she is able to account for any background or ambient,
naturally occurring radiation. Each location has multiple measurements taken at
different times of the day to account for variations.

To process this extensive data, Dr Ellen needs a program that can efficiently
handle the numerous measurements. The program should allow her to input the
radiation measurements for each location and then calculate essential statistical
insights. These insights include the average radiation level and the standard deviation to understand the variability.

Given the repetitive nature of the data input and the calculations required for
each set of measurements, the program must utilise loops effectively. For
instance, a for loop can iterate over each location's data set, while nested loops
can process individual measurements within those sets. Additionally, the program
should provide an option for Dr Ellen to continue inputting data until she
decides to stop, making use of a while loop.

The purpose of this case study is to consolidate the following Python topics:
- Fundamentals of for loops
- Designing nested for loops for multi-layered data processing
- Advantages of loop structures in reducing redundancy and errors
- Differentiating between for and while loops and their applications
- Practical applications of loops.
